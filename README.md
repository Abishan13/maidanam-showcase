## üéì What I Learned & Challenges

Throughout the development of **Maidanam**, I had the opportunity to:

- Design a complete **real-time sports tracking system**
- Implement **role-based authentication** and secure data access
- Optimize **real-time data listeners** with Firestore for live match updates
- Manage **push notifications** effectively across platforms
- Build a modular and scalable architecture with **React Context API & Custom Hooks**

- Ensure a seamless user experience with **dynamic theming** and proper state management

The biggest challenges were:
- Managing real-time data sync without performance issues
- Designing an intuitive UX for both casual users and admin roles
